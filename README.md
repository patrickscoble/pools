# Pools

## Overview
This is a coding challenge for C#/.NET developers that has been built as a React/.NET Core web application.

The application displays a collection of pools with different sizes and shapes.

There are three types of pools: Circle, Rectangle and Square.

The purpose of this challenge is for developers to enhance the application and demonstrate their understanding of object-oriented development concepts.

Please note the following:

- To simulate a real-world development experience, Internet use is allowed and encouraged.
- No React changes are required.

## Getting started

The instructions are available when running the application itself.

Before running the application, however, there is a deliberate build error that needs to be resolved.
